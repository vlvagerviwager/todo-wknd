Use Angular (Bootstrap?)
Look at todomvc
Make a simple web app - a list in the page with persisting items 
Use HTML5 STORAGE APIS - localStorage
Items can be ticked, which applies strikeout to the item

FEZ inspired?? 
Palette: grey and white

grunt-uncss

UX:

- check for localStorage support
- if no support, pop-up overlay to inform
- if list is empty, pop-up overlay with instructions
- cursor to Do this box - all text fields have sample text

- each item is draggable up/down
- each item is editable (click on text)
- each item is check-able (strikeout and fade font colour)
